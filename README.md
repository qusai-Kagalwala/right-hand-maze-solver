# right-hand-maze-solver
A Python implementation of the right-hand rule algorithm for maze solving. The bot prioritizes turning right when possible, moves forward when the path is clear, or turns left when blocked, ensuring it can navigate through any simply-connected maze by always keeping one hand on the wall.
